        description: |
          Consumes raw image outputs (OpenAI `b64_json` objects or data-URL
          strings), rescales each so its longest side is the requested dimension,
          embeds 300&nbsp;DPI metadata, stores the PNGs in Supabase Storage, and
          responds with JSON describing the uploaded files.

          Creates alternate sizes using previously stored file paths or inline
          payloads. Each resized PNG is uploaded to Supabase Storage with DPI

        description: |
          Removes transparent borders from a PNG input, optionally extending the
          detected bounding box by a few pixels of padding. The cropped PNG is
          saved to Supabase Storage with 300&nbsp;DPI metadata and the JSON response
